My name is Andy Scott, and I'm a Certified Player Agent with Octag8n Hockey.  I'm also a lawyer, and I 
teach sports law at the University of Ottawa Law School.

I'm doing a series of talks dedicated to certain aspects of the 2013 Collective Bargaining Agreement.  In 
the next discussion, I will explain the new CBA rules on contract variability for multi-year player 
contracts.

However, before looking at the rules under the current CBA, it'll be important to explain the background 
regarding how we got to this point.  To properly understand the landscape, you need to know that as a very 
general rule, the cap hit on a player is determined by taking the overall compensation of the contract and 
dividing this by the number of years in the term of the contract.  Under the 2005 CBA, many NHL players 
were signed to long-term, front-loaded contracts which means that higher salary amounts were paid in the 
first years of a contract with lower salary amounts paid in the last years of the contract.  The major 
reason for this structure was to artificially lower the Average Annual Value (AAV) of the contract with 
what is referred to as "throwaway years" at the end of the contract.

These were called "throwaway years" because it was argued that a player would actually have no intention 
of actually playing during those seasons, and so the NHL team could benefit from a lower cap hit on that 
contract, which mean that the club's overall payroll exceeded the salary cap under the CBA.

So, this was the big issue of the time, culminating in July 2010 when Ilya Kovalchuk signed a 17 year, 
\$102 million deal with the New Jersey Devils that was structured to have him never sign another contract 
until he was 44 years old.

93\% of the contract was to be paid out in the first 10 years of the 17 year deal.]

The deal was heavily front-loaded and would have paid Ilya \$95 million in the first 10 years and only 
\$7 million in the last seven seasons.  It was by far the most aggressive front-loaded contract that had 
been filed with the league, and the NHL responded by rejecting the deal on the grounds that it 
circumvented the NHL's salary cap rules.  They argued that neither Kovalchuk nor the Devils expected Ilya 
to play out his contract.  And therefore, artificially lowered the AAV of the contract.

It is also worth noting that the NHL indicated that they were investigating the contracts of Roberto 
Luongo, Marc Savard, Chris Pronger, and Marian Hossa.  In response to the NHL, the NHLPA filed a 
grievance with respect to Kovalchuk contract, but the NHL's position was upheld in arbitration and Ilya's 
contract was ultimately deemed a circumvention of the CBA's salary cap rules.  Now after the decision, 
the NHL and the NHLPA agreed to settle the issue and passed new regulations that would govern salary cap 
calculations for long term contracts for the remaining term of the 2005 CBA.  As part of this settlement, 
the NHL dropped their investigations into the contracts of Luongo, Savard, Pronger, and Hossa, and 
registered a revised contract for Ilya Kovalchuk for \$100 million over 15 years.  These regulations, 
which won't be discussed here as they are no longer binding, paved the way for one of the NHL's top 
priorities in negotiations for a new CBA in 2012.  And that was closing the loophole on heavily front-
loaded contracts, and passing new rules that governed the variability of an NHL contract.  Now let's 
discuss and deal with the new rules under the 2013 CBA.

First of all, there are two sets of rules regarding contract variability.  Front-loaded contracts and all 
other contracts.  Under the new CBA a contract is front-loaded if the average amount in the first half of 
the deal is greater than the cap hit.  I'd not that if the deal is an odd number, say five years, you 
just take 50% of the compensation of the middle year and count this as part of the first half.  Also, 
please note that throughout this session, "compensation" will refer to salary and signing bonuses.

Let's deal with front-loaded contracts first.  For a front-loaded contract, the variability in the first 
three years is limited to 35% of the first year's compensation.  Let's say a player earns \$2,000,000 in the first year of their deal.  35% of \$2,000,000 is \$700,000, 
and so the year to year variability of that deal cannot be greater than \$700,000.

The second rule of front-loaded contracts is that the lowest year's compensation cannot be less than 50\% 
of the highest year's compensation.  Going back to our player earning \$2,000,000 in the first year of a 
front-loaded deal.  If that was his lowest year in terms of compensation, then he cannot earn more than 
\$4,000,000 in any other year of the deal.

\bigskip
\bigskip
[On Screen:
\textsc{Example}
\begin{itemize}
\item First Year Compensation = \$2,000,000
\item 35\% of Compensation = \$2,000,000 * 0.35 = \$700,000
\item Therefore, the second year's compensation must be between \$1,300,000 and \$2,000,000.
\item Max Compensation, Year 2 = \$2,700,000 (Under year-to-year variability rules)
\item Max Compensation, Year 3 = \$3,400,000 (Also under year-to-year variability rules)
\item Max Compensation, Year 4 = \$4,000,000 (Under total variability limit)]
\bigskip
\bigskip


For all contracts other than front-loaded contracts, the 100% Rule applies.  Now this is arguably one of 
the most confusing and misinterpreted rules in the CBA.  But once you break it down, it is actually quite 
simple.  The first part of the rule involves the first two years of a multi-player contract [Note: multi-
year player contract].  The variability between the first year and the second year of a contract cannot 
exceed the lower of those two years.

\bigskip
\bigskip
[On Screen:
\begin{tabular}{l l l}
 & \textsc{Valid} & textsc{Invalid} \\
\textbf{Year} & \textbf{Compensation} & \textbf{Compensation} \\
1 & \$2,000,000 & \$2,000,000 \\
2 & \$4,000,000 & \$4,500,000 \\
\end{tabular}]
\bigskip
\bigskip

For instance, you may have a deal which pays \$2 million in year one and \$4 million in year two.  
However, you cannot have a deal that pays \$2 million in year one and \$4.5 million in year two because 
the variability would be greater than the lower of those two years being \$2 million.  The second part of 
the rule involves variability during the subsequent years of the contract, and there is a different 
treatment for decreases vs increases in player salary and bonuses.

Let's deal with increases first.  Any increase in compensation cannot exceed the lower of the first two 
years of the contract.  Going back to our example of a player earning \$2 million in year one and \$4 
million in year two, the lower of those years is obviously \$2 million, and so the highest increase in 
compensation from one year to the next for that contract is \$2 million.  

\bigskip
\bigskip
[On Screen:
\begin{tabular}{l l l}
\textbf{Contract Year} & \textbf{Compensation} & \\
1 & \$2,000,000 & \\
2 & \$4,000,000 & \\
3 & \$6,000,000 & Max Increase equal to lower of
4 & \$8,000,000 & first two years compensation]
\bigskip
\bigskip

Now, the rules for year-to-year variability are different when it comes to decreases in compensation.  
Decreases in compensation may not exceed 50\% of the lesser of the first two years of the contract. So 
this warrants an example.  Let's go back to our player that earns $\2 million in year one and \$4 million 
in year two on a non-frontloaded contract.  From one year to the next, his contract may not decrease by 
more than 50% of the lowest of his first two years, and the lowest amount in the first two years was \$2 
million, as we discussed.  And so 50\% of \$2 million is \$1 million, and so he cannot have a decrease in 
his compensation year to year by more than \$1 million.  So looking ahead to year three for that player, 
if you're at \$2 million in year one and \$4 million in year two, he cannot make less than \$3 million in 
year three.

\bigskip
\bigskip
[On Screen:
\begin{tabular}{l l l}
\textbf{Contract Year} & \textbf{Compensation} & \\
1 & \$2,000,000 & The maximum decrease
2 & \$4,000,000 & allowed is \$1 million, 
3 & \$3,000,000 & or half of year 1 - the
4 & \$2,000,000 & lower of the first two]
\bigskip
\bigskip

Now, another critical rule in the CBA involves the length of a player contract.  Under the old CBA, there 
was no express limit on the number of contracts, or the number of years sorry, for a contract, with the 
exception of players in the entry-level system.  Under the new CBA, the maximum term on a contract is 7 
years unless a player is re-signing with the same team, in which case that term limit is 8 years. 
[Repeats from farther perspective]

So, to summarize our discussion today - on a front-loaded contract, the variability between years cannot 
be greater than 35\% of the amount of the first year's compensation.  Also, on front-loaded contracts, 
the lowest year's compensation may not be less than 50\% of the highest year's compensation.  With 
respect to contracts that are not front loaded, the 100\% rule applies.  The first part of this rule 
indicates that the variability between the first two years of a player contract may not exceed the 
compensation in the lower of those two years.  Beyond the first two years of the contract, the increase 
in compensation from one year to the next cannot exceed the lower of the first two years of that contract.  
Again, this is for the 100\% rule.  And any decrease in compensation may not exceed 50\% of the lesser 
amount of the first two years of the contract.  Also, a player cannot have a term greater than seven 
years unless a player is re-signing with the same team, in which case they can be eight years.

Okay, so first off, I know this stuff can get convoluted and somewhat confusing, but I want to thank 
everyone for watching, and please to check out some of my other clips on other topics which include the 
entry-level system, schedule A and B bonuses, and other provisions of the CBA.  Again, my name is Andy 
Scott, and I'm an NHLPA Certified Agent.  If you have any questions, please contact me.  Thank you.
